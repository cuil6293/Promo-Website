<h1>A little about Kirby</h2>
<div class="container">
	<img class="mirror" src="KirbyMirrorWorld.jpg">
	<p class="p1">Despite being a cute <span id = "pink">pink</span> ball of joy, Kirby is quite the mysterious fellow. He has an incredibly elastic body that can expand to help him fly. But that's not all, Kirby has the uncanny ability to eat his enemies and absorb their powers. Spooky! Thankfully he's taken the path of a hero, especially after saving his homeworld, Planet Popstar. He's since moved on to save other worlds and lands.</p>
